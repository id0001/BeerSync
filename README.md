# BeerSync

BeerSync is an app that will download your list of unique beerst from Untappd and keep it synchronized. So that when you are in an area with a bad or non-existent internet connection, you can still check whether you've already drank that beer you wanted to order or buy or not.

It also provides a quick search function, sorting and grouping.

## Disclaimer
This repository is not complete. It misses a couple of dependencies which I could not find anymore and therefore I am unable to build the app without significant changes.

It has also been removed from the PlayStore by me because of this reason.

This repository is for reference purposes only.
